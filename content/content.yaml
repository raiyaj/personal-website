introduction:
  bio: >-
    Hi, I'm Raiya Jessa. I'm a software developer and computer science
    student in Vancouver, Canada. At the moment, I'm finishing my last
    semester of school, participating in a virtual workshop series with
    <a href='https://www.resourcemovement.org'>Resource Movement</a>,
    learning about modern web development (by building this site!),
    and finding a path into civic technology.

    This is my personal landing page: my web development playground
    and where I document what I'm learning, reading, and making.
