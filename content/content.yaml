    Hi, I'm Raiya Jessa. I'm a software developer and computer science
    student in Vancouver, Canada, with an interest in using technology
    for good. At the moment, I'm finishing my last semester of
    school, learning Gatsby.js and React.js (in part, by building this
    site!), and beginning to <a href='/blog'>write</a> about my coding
    (and life) experiments.

    This is my personal landing page: my web development playground
    and where I document what I'm learning, reading, and making.
